### Hey, I'm Vanessa Pereira! 👋

I work as a frontend developer. I'm based in Porto, Portugal.

Since 2020 I've been living and breathing web development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces. I've the chance to immerse myself in some projects, helping to make this world a little better through code. ✨

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm watching a movie, studying languages or simply reading a book.

### What I'm focusing on ⚡💻

Currently improving my PHP and React skills...

### Find me elsewhere 🌍
